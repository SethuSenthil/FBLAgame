## Blurb
This repo contains our submission for the FBLA [computer game simulation programming] (https://www.fbla-pbl.org/competitive-event/computer-game-simulation-programming/) prejudged event. It has all the required features
mentioned in the [official rubrick](https://www.fbla-pbl.org/media/Computer-Game-and-Simulation-Programming-FBLA-Rating-Sheet.pdf). 
Does the code make you scared and bring the urge to give up? Don't worry! A good game doesn't guarantee anything, it all depends on these factors:
- a functional game (is enough & you don't need to code it caus they don't really know)
- decent UI & UX
- presentation 
- luck & karma üôè
Infacet we didn't even place top 5 at states in NJ! We learnt that it is not about the game nor presentation but solely upon how the judges understand so optimize and improv accordingly.
Note that many judges aren't from FBLA and most likely aren't found with computer programming at all. One of the judges said he was just told to sit in a room and interview. Lastly don't forget
to mention features that are mentioned on the rubric and that are mandatory.
